## 📈 Sentiment Change Impact

Following a fire incident affecting FY21 production:
- Revenue revised to **$1,100m**
- Gross margin adjusted to **50%**
- Resulted in **~10% decrease in enterprise value**
- Outlook remains **structurally intact** due to strong brand equity and insured asset base

This highlights how **operational sentiment shifts** can temporarily affect valuation without altering long-term fundamentals.
